Basic synthesizer using Arduino, Wii Nunchuck, and Mozzi sound synthesis library. Instructable can be found at
http://www.instructables.com/id/Wii-Nunchuck-Synthesizer-Using-Arduino-and-Mozzi-S/

Make sure you download both the WiiChuck Class from the Arduino Playground (included) and the latest Mozzi from their website http://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/donate/.

Special thanks to Tod E. Kurt, and Tim Hirzel for WiiChuck for making interfacing the Nunchuck so simple and Mozzi for their well documented and awesome library.
