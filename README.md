# WiiMusic
Basic synthesizer using Arduino, Wii Nunchuck, and Mozzi sound synthesis library. 

Make sure you download both the WiiChuck Class from the Arduino Playground and the latest Mozzi from their website.

Special thanks to WiiChuck for making interfacing the Nunchuck so simple and Mozzi for their well documented and awesome library.
